\section{Use \noindent Case Modelling}
	
		\subsection{ Based on your domain model create scenarios by modeling the main use \noindent Cases
			and actors as one or more UML use \noindent Case diagram.}
		
			\noindent Case \#1:\\
			(floorplan import)
			importing a background image into the application to be a floorplan\\
			
			
			\noindent Case \#2:\\
			(floorplan export)
			exporting a plan with all the furnitures inside\\
			
			
			\noindent Case \#3:\\
			(catalogue extension)
			importing an image into the application to be a furniture\\
			
			
			\noindent Case \#4:\\
			(catalogue extension)
			drawing in the application to be a furniture\\
			
			
			\noindent Case \#5:\\
			(floorplan, provide information)
			the size of the flat, free vs occupied space, and in-depth info on that\\
			
			
			\noindent Case \#6:\\
			(floorplan validation)
			constraints and rules are applied to check if the arrangement is logically and physically sound\\
			
			
			\noindent Case \#7:\\
			(SSO Login Features)
			in order to allow users to login to our social platform, they are allowed to login via other respected accounts such as Gmail and Facebook\\
			SSO = single-sign-on\\
			
			\noindent Case \#8:\\
			(user, comment)
			users should be allowed to comment on the other published projects\\
			
			
			\noindent Case \#9:\\
			(content moderation)
			user-generated contents have to be inspected before they are allowed to publish (the uploader can see the upload on our website, but others would not until an admin approves the content)
			sub\noindent Cases:\\ floor related (copyright or inappropriate designs), comment-related (laws of speech, inappropriate context)\\
			
			
			\noindent Case \#10:\\
			(user, design)
			users should be allowed to rotate and move furnitures inside a floorplan\\

		\subsection{Explain the advantages of using activity diagrams.}
		
		Although use-case diagrams are helpful for discussing how a system broadly behaves, they are not enough to show the underlying logic. With activity diagrams, a observer can see which component is conveying what kind of information, and how decisions are made.\\
		
		In other words, activity diagrams display also both the positive and negative deviations, and easier to observe than use case diagrams.
