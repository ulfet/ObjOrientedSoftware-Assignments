\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Walls, Doors, Windows}

Wall, Door and Window are extending ImageFigure.
Also, Door and Window are created by a special CreationTool named "CreateInWallElement".
It checks that doors and windows are always placed on a wall.
If not, it intercepts the call of the framework to mousePressed.
